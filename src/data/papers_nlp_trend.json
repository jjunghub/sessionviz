This classifier serves as a baseline to compare to subsequent results. Second, we propose two ensemble techniques which aggregate our baseline classifier with other surface classifiers widely used in Sentiment Analysis. Third, we also propose two models for combining both surface and deep features to merge information from several sources. Fourth, we introduce a taxonomy for classifying the different models found in the literature, as well as the ones we propose. Fifth, we conduct several experiments to compare the performance of these models with the deep learning baseline. For this, we use seven public datasets that were extracted from the microblogging and movie reviews domain. Finally, as a result, a statistical study confirms that the performance of these proposed models surpasses that of our original baseline on Fl-Score. (C) 2017 The Authors.

This information can be utilized for public health monitoring tasks, particularly for pharmacovigilance, via the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques. However, the language in social media is highly informal, and userexpressed medical concepts are often nontechnical, descriptive, and challenging to extract. There has been limited progress in addressing these challenges, and thus far, advanced machine learning-based NLP techniques have been underutilized. Our objective is to design a machine learning-based approach to extract mentions of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from highly informal text in social media. Methods: We introduce ADRMine, a machine learning-based concept extraction system that uses conditional random fields (CRFs). ADRMine utilizes a variety of features, including a novel feature for modeling words' semantic similarities. The similarities are modeled by clustering words based on unsupervised, pretrained word representation vectors (embeddings) generated from unlabeled user posts in social media using a deep learning technique. Results: ADRMine outperforms several strong baseline systems in the ADR extraction task by achieving an F-measure of 0.82.

However, the performance of BOW sometimes remains limited due to some fundamental deficiencies in handling the polarity shift problem. We propose a model called dual sentiment analysis (DSA), to address this problem for sentiment classification. We first propose a novel data expansion technique by creating a sentiment-reversed review for each training and test review. On this basis, we propose a dual training algorithm to make use of original and reversed training reviews in pairs for learning a sentiment classifier, and a dual prediction algorithm to classify the test reviews by considering two sides of one review. We also extend the DSA framework from polarity (positive-negative) classification to 3-class (positive-negative-neutral) classification, by taking the neutral reviews into consideration. Finally, we develop a corpus-based method to construct a pseudo-antonym dictionary, which removes DSA's dependency on an external antonym dictionary for review reversion. We conduct a wide range of experiments including two tasks, nine datasets, two antonym dictionaries, three classification algorithms, and two types of features.

This article addresses this question in four ways: introducing the first multimodal dataset with opinion-level sentiment intensity annotations; studying the prototypical interaction patterns between facial gestures and spoken words when inferring sentiment intensity; proposing a new computational representation, called multimodal dictionary, based on a language-gesture study; and evaluating the authors' proposed approach in a speaker-independent paradigm for sentiment intensity prediction. The authors' study identifies four interaction types between facial gestures and verbal content: neutral, emphasizer, positive, and negative interactions.

Various semantic information representation models have been proposed, however existing approaches have their setbacks. Notable weaknesses among these are: (1) tradition VSM methods, completely ignore the semantic information; (2) averaging word embedding methods, cannot depict the synthetical semantic meaning of the given document; (3) neural network methods, require complex structure and are notoriously difficult to be trained. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but novel method which we call bag of meta-words (BoMW). In our method, the semantic information of the document is indicated by a meta-words vector in which every single meta-word element denotes particular semantic information. Especially, these meta-words are extracted from pre-trained word embeddings through two different but complemental models, naive interval meta-words (NIM) and feature combination meta-words (FCM). In general, our new model BoMW is as simple as traditional VSM model but it can capture the synthetical semantic meanings of the document. Numerous experiments on two benchmarks (IMDB dataset and Pang's dataset) are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the results show that the performance of our method can exceed the traditional VSM methods and methods using pre-trained word embedding.", "publication": "Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks", "pub_year": 2018, "cereb_cite": 2, "max_cite": 0, "citeburst": [{"year": 1969, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1970, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1971, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1972, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1973, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1974, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1975, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1976, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1977, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1978, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1979, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1980, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1981, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1982, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1983, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1984, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1985, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1986, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1987, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1988, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1989, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1990, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1991, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1992, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1993, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1994, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1995, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1996, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1997, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1998, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1999, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2000, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2001, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2002, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2003, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2004, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2005, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2006, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2007, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2008, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2009, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2010, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2011, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2012, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2013, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2014, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2015, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2016, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2017, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2018, "cite": 2}]}, {"title": "Towards automatic filtering of fake reviews", "authors": ["cereb_349546", "cereb_243607", "cereb_212211", "cereb_243608"], "abstract": "\u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Most organizations have high-level requirement specifications that include a set of ACPs, which describe allowable operations of the system. It is time consuming and error-prone to manually sift through these documents and extract ACPs. In this paper, we propose a new framework towards extracting ACPs from unrestricted natural language documents using semantic role labeling (SRL).

Bug reports often contain product name, product component, description, and severity. Based on such information, triagers often manually prioritize the bug reports for investigation. However, manual prioritization is time-consuming and cumbersome. DRONE is an automated state-of-the-art approach that recommends the priority level information of the bug reports. However, its performance for all levels of priorities are not uniform and may be improved. To this end, in this paper we propose an emotion-based automatic approach to predict the priority for a report. First, we exploit natural language processing techniques to preprocess the bug report. Second, we identify the emotion-words that are involved in the description of the bug report and assign it an emotion-value. Third, we create a feature vector for the bug report and predict its priority with a machine learning classifier that is trained with history data collected from the Internet. We evaluate the proposed approach on Eclipse open-source projects and the results of the cross-project evaluation suggest that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art. On average it improves the F1-score by more than six percent.", "publication": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report", "pub_year": 2018, "cereb_cite": 0, "max_cite": 0, "citeburst": [{"year": 1969, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1970, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1971, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1972, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1973, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1974, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1975, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1976, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1977, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1978, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1979, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1980, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1981, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1982, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1983, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1984, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1985, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1986, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1987, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1988, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1989, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1990, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1991, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1992, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1993, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1994, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1995, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1996, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1997, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1998, "cite": 0}, {"year": 1999, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2000, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2001, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2002, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2003, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2004, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2005, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2006, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2007, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2008, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2009, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2010, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2011, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2012, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2013, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2014, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2015, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2016, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2017, "cite": 0}, {"year": 2018, "cite": 0}]}]}
